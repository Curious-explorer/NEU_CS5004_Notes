# Intro -
1. Unit testing is going to play a real major role in this entire subject.
2. **Like most professional IDEs, Eclipse includes a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. **
3. **It allows you to organize your work into several files that together comprise a project, and organizes several projects into a workspace.**
4. In eclipse you can add **TODO** keyword at the start of the single line comment and it will remember the position on right scroll bar as blue square.
5. In Window - Show View - Show Tasks will show all the TODO tagged comments.
6. In Java camelCase is used to write commands and variable names.
7. **PRO TIP!!!** - Click on a JUnit Test file and then check coverage as - it should show 100.... Meaning you covered 100% of possible tests for given class.



# Testing -
1. White Box Test - We know the details of the function or method which we are testing.
2. Black Box Test - We do not know the details of the function or method which we are testing, we just know what output is to be expected.
3. So if we write a test only based on documentation, which tells us what function is supposed to do, then it is called as Black-box testing.

6. **The best way to write tests is to write tests before you write the code itself.**
7. **Man, the quizes are from module contents, just keep eye on the code and you will be fine!!!**
