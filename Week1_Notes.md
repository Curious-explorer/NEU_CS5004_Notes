## Notes -
1. Computers do not work with information: they work with data , which is a way to represent information that makes it ''convenient" to use.
2. Information like Book A is written by author XYZ. Or "it is 75 degrees Farenheit outside"
3. Data is straightforward.
4. **Variables** are named locations in the memory where you can store data! ...So in a way you can say variables are memory addresses where we store the data.
5. In java, char are stored in ' ' (single quotes), and string is stored in " " (double quotes).
6. Learn about the basic OO principles more carefully!
7. Why do you think String is capitalized in Java? - because it is a class, and it is common programming style to make the first letter of a class uppercase.
8. Naming: class names in Java always are written in TitleCase, and field names are always written in camelCase. Primitive type names, like int and boolean , are lowercase.
9. Comments: a multi-line comment can be enclosed between /* and */ as shown. A single-line comment starts with //
10. If we name the class Person then it is saved in a file Person.java . This allows us to divide our code in meaningful chunks, although one-class-per-file is not strictly enforced.
